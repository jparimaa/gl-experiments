# gl-experiments

## General

Experimenting with OpenGL features and implementing simple examples of real-time graphic features. Framework contains common code for all projects, creates a context and calls the functions (initialize, update, render etc.) that a user shall implement. Framework also offers some helper-classes to avoid reimplementing the wheel. See each folder for more information.
